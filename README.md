Unsupervised Representation Learning for Physiological Time Series
Overview
This project explores unsupervised methods for learning representations from physiological time series data to facilitate early disease detection in healthcare settings. While traditional approaches rely on supervised learning with labeled data, unsupervised techniques offer promising alternatives for identifying subtle precursors of disease from continuous physiological measurements before clinical symptoms become apparent.

Models Implemented
The project implements and benchmarks six key representation learning approaches:

Temporal Contrastive Learning (TS-TCC) - Combines temporal and contextual contrasting mechanisms to capture comprehensive patterns in time series data
Recurrent Autoencoder - Captures temporal dependencies through recurrent architecture while learning compressed representations
Informative Missingness Model - Leverages patterns of missing data to extract valuable clinical information
Signature Transform Clustering - Uses mathematical path transformation theory to represent sequential physiological measurements
Statistical Feature Representation - Extracts interpretable statistical features for efficient representations
Recurrent Generative Adversarial Networks (RGAN) - Learns representations that capture essential characteristics of physiological data
Key Findings
Neural network approaches (RGAN, Recurrent Autoencoder, Informative Missingness model, TS-TCC) demonstrated superior classification performance (91.7-92.0% accuracy)
Mathematical approaches (Statistical Features and Signature Transform) showed advantages in computational efficiency, interpretability, and clustering capability
Consistent physiological patterns emerged across models, including "Hemodynamically Unstable," "Febrile/Inflammatory," "Respiratory Compromise," "Compensated Shock," and "Labile Physiology" profiles
Results suggest a potential shift from threshold-based to pattern-based physiological monitoring that recognizes complex, multivariate patterns
